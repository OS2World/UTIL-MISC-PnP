PnP 0.14vk is a port of PnP / Craig Hart
done by Veit Kannegieser for OS/2 and DOS using VP 2.1

differences:
  * Uses 16-Bit protected mode PnP BIOS interface 
    (SystemSoft bios returns bad values and corrupt buffers
     for real mode..)

    pnp32_d.exe - DOS (DPMI) Version
                  needs no driver, but access to shadow RAM

    pnp32_o.exe - OS/2 Version
                  needs device=PNP_BIOS.SYS installed
    
  * puffer size problems solved
  * loads id table at start
  * uses classes.pas, .. from pci program
  * added lines to pnpid.txt

Current version if compiled with a lot of extra debuginfo and error
handling. Please report bugs of this version to Veit.Kannegieser@gmx.de.

If you have problems running the DPMI version under a memory manger
or in a DOS session make sure the entire ROM area is visible (no upper memory)
and accessible. If not possible, try plain DOS.
You should be award that running this program could risk a system hang,
to be safer close other programs and flush disk cache...
